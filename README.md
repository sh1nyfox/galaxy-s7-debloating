# Debloating the Galaxy S7 to bring it back to life

The Samsung Galaxy S7 is one of my favourite Android phones. The size is still perfect to this day (regardless of the actual display size), both cameras are good and the front mounted fingerprint sensor is very 2020 (Face ID be damned).

I've kept mine around in a drawer, albeit having lived a hard life including glass replacement on the rear. Samsung supported it for a pretty long time with updates, too, and while future security patches will be an issue, it's still a decent little phone as it sits.

It's also full of bloatware so this little project is me trying to strip it back and see how good I can make it in 2020.

Here's hoping.

I'll be starting fairly conservatively but it's a work in progress and will be updated as and when I make new, good changes. And the usual disclaimer, anything you do to your own phone is done at your own risk.

Still putting this together right now from a past template so it'll look a mess for a while.
